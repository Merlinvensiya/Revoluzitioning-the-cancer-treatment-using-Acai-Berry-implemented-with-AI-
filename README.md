I. Introduction
The acai berry (*Euterpe oleracea*) is widely recognized for its high nutritional value and potential health benefits, including antioxidant properties that may contribute to cancer prevention. Efficient cultivation of acai berries is crucial for maximizing yield and market value while exploring their health benefits. This study aims to:
1. Predict the yield of acai berries using various agricultural parameters.
2. Estimate the market price of acai berries.
3. Classify the potential of acai berries in cancer prevention studies.
The acai berry, known for its significant health benefits, particularly in cancer prevention, has garnered widespread attention. This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict critical agricultural outcomes for acai berry cultivation, including yield, market price, and potential cancer prevention study findings. By analyzing a dataset of 400 records with comprehensive parameters, we developed predictive models to assist farmers and researchers in optimizing acai berry production and understanding its health benefits. This proposed work highlights the potential of machine learning in agricultural optimization and health research, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven agriculture and healthcare applications. The proposed work employed Gradient Boosting algorithms for regression and classification tasks. The Gradient Boosting Regressor was used to predict the yield and market price, while the Gradient Boosting Classifier was applied to determine the cancer prevention study findings. The models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R²), and classification report metrics. Finally the performance evaluation demonstrated the models' ability to provide accurate predictions, offering valuable insights into acai berry cultivation and its potential in cancer prevention. The predictive function developed allows users to input various agricultural parameters and obtain predictions for yield, market price, and cancer prevention study findings, facilitating informed decision-making. In our proposed work we utilised the Gradient Boosting Regressor model with optimized parameters ('learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 3, 'n_estimators': 100) and predicted the yield of Acai berries. The model's performance, as indicated by the high Mean Squared Error: 369205.599931186 and Root Mean Squared Error: 607.6229093205641 which helps in successfully predicting acai berry yield and market price. Effective classification of cancer prevention findings and Potential applications in optimizing agricultural practices and health research.
